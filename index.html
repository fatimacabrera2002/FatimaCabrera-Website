        <div class="subheading mb-5">UCR Undergraduate StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second-year student at University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Liberal Studies and hoping to become an educator. I am a first gen student in my family so I have been working really hard and passing all my classes. Fortunately, I got a full-ride to UCR and I have had less stress on my shoulders. One of my biggest encouragements to keep my full ride is to maintain good grades. I am currently finishing up my general ed classes in order to be able to start on my upper division classes the upcoming fall quarter. I have also been looking into possible teaching programs. Growing up I have always wanted to be a teacher therefore, I always took opportunities to work with different grade levels to get an idea of what grade I will want to teach. 
<br><br>

        Luckily, one of my high school programs, AVID, gave a lot of volunteering opportunities. So far, I have done some volunteer tutoring jobs at nearby elementary schools, such as Boulder Ridge Elementary School and Val Verde Elementary School. These jobs would range from weekend STEM workshops or weekday volunteer work as a teacher assistant. I have interacted with the students and helped them throughout learning activities. I have had the opportunity to do group projects and gain the students' trust. As a teacher assistant, I got to understand the average day for my future career. I was there from the beginning of the school day till the end and the teacher did not just let me help around in the classroom but they also let me lead small lessons in the classroom. I felt more than a teacher assistant in those moments and it reassured me that I felt like I was on the right track.
<br><br>

        E Meanwhile I get into any teaching programs, I have an after school job. I have a part-time job as a cashier at the 99cent Store. After school, I go to this job and work five hour shifts. Before starting this job, I struggled a lot with social anxiety and I could hardly go to public places without having an anxiety attack, this would ruin many cool experiences for me and I would miss out on a lot. However, as a cashier you are expected to interact with different people everyday. Although at first I was quiet and would hardly speak up or stand up for myself, now two years later I am the complete opposite. I can now make eye contact and hold a conversation with the customers as well as standing up for myself when a hostile situation occurs. I feel like these skills have helped me a lot outside of work. Such as volunteering in class or in other scenarios. I used to not ask questions during classes or if I was confused somewhere else because of the fear of interacting socially. Now, when everybody else doesnâ€™t want to ask questions I put my fears aside and speak up. These skills have branched out socially to academically, since I ask questions I am able to understand concepts that are being taught and a main reason as to why I have been able to pass my classes. I think that all this combined is going to help me when beginning my teaching career, although I have always dreamed of being an educator, I hated the idea of standing in front of students and having to speak. Now, when I think about it I feel excitement for whatâ€™s ahead because I do not fear teaching kids and presenting.
